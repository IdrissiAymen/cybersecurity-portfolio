# Introduction to Defensive Security - TryHackMe Challenge

## Objective
Understand the core components of defensive security, including SOC operations, threat intelligence, DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response), and the major phases of incident response. Practice basic skills in detecting and mitigating threats using a SIEM and firewall.

## Key Concepts Learned
- **Security Operations Center (SOC):** The central team responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Gathering and analyzing data on potential attackers, tools, and tactics.
- **DFIR:** Digital Forensics and Incident Response, involving investigation and containment of incidents.
- **Incident Response Phases:** Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication & Recovery.

## Lab Activity
1. **Threat Detection:**  
   - Used a SIEM to identify suspicious activity originating from a malicious IP address.
2. **Investigation:**  
   - Ran the IP through an IP scanner to gather additional intelligence.
3. **Mitigation:**  
   - Blocked the malicious IP address on the firewall to prevent further intrusion.

## Skills Gained
- Using SIEM tools to investigate alerts.
- Performing IP address analysis.
- Applying firewall rules for threat mitigation.
- Understanding the workflow of defensive security teams.

## Takeaway
Defensive security requires quick identification, analysis, and mitigation of threats. SOC analysts play a critical role in protecting infrastructure by combining real-time monitoring tools with threat intelligence.
