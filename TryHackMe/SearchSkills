# Search Skills

This module covers efficient search techniques for cybersecurity and technical research, including specialized search engines and vulnerability databases.

## Key Topics

- **Identifying Bogus Cryptography ("Snake Oil")**  
  Learn to recognize fraudulent or weak cryptographic methods and products.

- **Linux Network Tools**  
  Understand that `netstat` is deprecated in modern Linux and replaced by:
  - `ss` → socket statistics and active connections.
  - `ip` → network interface, routing, and address management.

- **Advanced Google Search**  
  Use operators like:
  - `filetype:pdf` → search results limited to PDF files.
  - Other operators to refine and target search queries.

- **Specialized Search Engines & Databases**
  - **Shodan** → search for internet-exposed devices and services.
  - **Censys** → internet-wide scanning and asset discovery.
  - **VirusTotal** → scan files/URLs with multiple antivirus engines.
  - **Have I Been Pwned** → check if accounts/emails have been compromised.

- **Vulnerability Research**
  - **CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** → standard identifiers for security flaws.
  - **Exploit Database** → publicly available exploits and PoCs.
  - **GitHub** → repositories containing CVE references, exploit code, or security research.
