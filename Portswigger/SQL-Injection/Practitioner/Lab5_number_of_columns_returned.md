# Lab: SQL Injection UNION Attack â€“ Determining the Number of Columns

ðŸ”— **Lab Link**: [PortSwigger â€“ Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/union-attacks/lab-determine-number-of-columns)  

---

##  Lab Summary
In this lab, you must exploit a **SQL injection vulnerability** using a **UNION-based attack** to discover how many columns the original query returns. This is a foundational step before you can extract any real data using UNION injections. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

##  Step-by-Step Exploitation

### 1. Identify injection point
Intercept the request (e.g., via Burp Suite) and locate the `category` parameterâ€”or equivalentâ€”that appears vulnerable.

### 2. Use `UNION SELECT null, null, null--`
Inject the following payload:

' UNION SELECT null, null, null--

### 3. Observe response
If the page returns normally (without error), the payload has successfully executed, confirming the original query returns 3 columns.
