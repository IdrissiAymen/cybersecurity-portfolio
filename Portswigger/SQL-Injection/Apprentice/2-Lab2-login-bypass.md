# SQL Injection: Authentication Bypass (Apprentice)

**Lab:** SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

## üìù Description
This lab demonstrates how SQL injection can be used to bypass authentication in a login form.  
By modifying the username input, I was able to trick the query into always returning `TRUE`, allowing me to log in as the administrator without knowing the password.  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Taken
1. Tested the login form by entering:  
admin'--
- This caused an error, which indicated that the input was being concatenated directly into an SQL query.  

2. Then I crafted a payload that always evaluates to true:  
admin' OR 1=1--

- The query behind the scenes became something like:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR 1=1--' AND password = '...';
  ```  
- Because `1=1` is always true, the query bypassed the password check.

## ‚úÖ Result
- Successfully logged in as the **administrator** user without needing the correct password.

## üìö What I Learned
- How SQL injection can be used to bypass authentication mechanisms.  
- How login forms are especially vulnerable when input is not sanitized.  
- The importance of testing different payloads to identify exploitable queries.
