## Bandit Level 14 â†’ 15

Challenge: The password for the next level had to be retrieved by submitting the current password to a service running locally on port 30000.

##### nc localhost 30000

Then I provided the bandit14 password, and the service responded with the password for bandit15.
Key Skill Learned: How to use netcat to interact with network services and understand client-server communication over TCP.
